    "## MNIST Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Get the Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We load a small portion (1000 images) of the MNIST dataset, which contains handwritten digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Make the Data Easier to Use:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We flatten the images from 2D (28x28 pixels) to 1D arrays.\n",
    "- We adjust the pixel values from 0-255 to 0-1 for better calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Convert Labels to a Special Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of just having a number for each digit (e.g., 3 for '3'), we use a code with 10 numbers.\n",
    "- For the correct digit, the code has a 1 in that position, and 0s everywhere else (like a one-hot code). This helps the model understand the categories better.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Do the Same for the Test Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We repeat steps 2 and 3 for the test images and labels, preparing them for later testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now the MNIST data is ready for a machine learning model to learn to recognize handwritten digits!**\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this explanation is even simpler and easier to understand."

    "**1. tanh:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Behavior:**\n",
    "    - S-shaped function, mapping real numbers to the range **[-1, 1]**.\n",
    "    - Output increases gradually as input increases, but plateaus near -1 and 1.\n",
    "- **Properties:**\n",
    "    - Zero-centered: Output is 0 when input is 0.\n",
    "    - Smooth gradient: Enables easier learning compared to step-like functions.\n",
    "    - Non-linearity: Introduces non-linearity, crucial for learning complex patterns.\n",
    "- **Applications:**\n",
    "    - Often used in hidden layers of neural networks.\n",
    "    - Can also be used as an output layer activation for tasks with a bipolar scale (e.g., sentiment analysis).\n",

    "- **Behavior:**\n",
    "    - Takes a vector of real numbers and normalizes it into a probability distribution.\n",
    "    - Each element in the output vector represents the probability of belonging to a specific class.\n",
    "    - Outputs always sum to 1.\n",
    "- **Properties:**\n",
    "    - Ensures outputs are non-negative and interpretable as probabilities.\n",
    "    - Forces competition between classes, encouraging the network to focus on the most likely class.\n",
    "- **Applications:**\n",
    "    - Primarily used in the output layer of multi-class classification tasks (e.g., image recognition, handwritten digit recognition).\n",

For each input value `x`, it squishes it between -1 and 1 using the formula `tanh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / (e^x + e^(-x))`. This helps to limit the output of the network and introduce non-linearity, improving its learning capabilities.\n",
