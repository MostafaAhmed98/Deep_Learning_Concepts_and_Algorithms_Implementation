    " **exponentially weighted averages (EWMAs):**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What they are:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A way to calculate an average that gives more weight to recent data points, making it especially useful for tracking trends in time-series data.\n",
    "- It achieves this by assigning decreasing weights to older data points in an exponential manner—like an echo that gradually fades away.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How they work:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose a weighting parameter (β):** This value, between 0 and 1, determines how quickly the weights decline. Higher β values place more emphasis on recent data.\n",
    "2. **Initialize the EWMA:** Start with the first data point as the initial EWMA value.\n",
    "3. **Calculate the EWMA for each subsequent data point:**\n",
    "   - Use the formula: `EWMA_t = β * EWMA_(t-1) + (1 - β) * x_t`\n",
    "      - `EWMA_t` is the EWMA at time t\n",
    "      - `EWMA_(t-1)` is the previous EWMA value\n",
    "      - `x_t` is the current data point\n",
    "4. **Update iteratively:** The EWMA value is updated with each new data point, creating a smooth, responsive average that reflects the most recent trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Smoothness:** EWMAs are effective at reducing noise and revealing underlying trends.\n",
    "- **Responsiveness:** They adapt quickly to changes in data, making them valuable for real-time tracking.\n",
    "- **Computational efficiency:** They require minimal memory and processing power, making them practical for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common applications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Finance:** Stock price analysis, volatility modeling, risk management\n",
    "- **Signal processing:** Noise reduction, trend identification\n",
    "- **Machine learning:** Optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent with momentum), model training\n",
    "- **Other fields:** Inventory control, sales forecasting, weather prediction, and more\n"
